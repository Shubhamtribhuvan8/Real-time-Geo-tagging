# How it Works?
# Features
User Registration/Login: Users can create a new account, log into the system using their credentials, and log out when done.
Image Upload: Users can upload images from their device, which are securely and efficiently stored.
Geo-tagging: Each uploaded image is tagged with the user's current geographical location, with the user's permission.
Image Display: The main page displays a real-time feed of images uploaded by users.
Image Filtering: Users can filter the image feed based on location and see images tagged at a specific location.
Real-time Updates: New images matching the current filter automatically appear in the feed without requiring a page refresh.
